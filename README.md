Disclaimer: This was meant to be a holiday greeting and not a pit of nonsense, so I’m sending it now.

This message is temporary and will be deleted. But I still haven't figured out how, oh my God...
I'm not afraid of rejection; I'm afraid of not trying. I came to my senses after the exacerbation of the illness, as if I suddenly woke up and noticed that something was missing. My life is like a puzzle with most of the pieces lost or worn out.
Don't bother, don't worry. 
The usual greeting, I had some fragments of dreams. I don't remember anything that happened; I probably won't find out. Because you left and didn't come back. Only in dreams, sometimes something reminds me of the past.
There was a lot of good. Without saying "thank you" or "goodbye" or "fuck you" (lol) – it would be wrong (maybe it was, but I feel like I've been abandoned). I can't believe you're gone.
Just want to say happy birthday.
Happy birthday!
On this special day, I want to take a moment to celebrate you. Happy Birthday! You are incredibly special to me, and I am grateful for every moment we have shared.
I hope the date is correct, but who cares. 
I love/hate you/don't know/don't remember who you are.
And in time I will forget it as I have forgotten you; it's sad.
It's a pity that you are not here, and I don't remember how we met, what games we played, or those photos of the stars. So many copies of this photo on each of my Google drives; it's a treasure I managed to save.
Maybe in the next life, we will understand each other; I would like to try it again. Maybe you are my favorite mistake in all lives and universes.
Yes, I still love you more than I hate you, shit.
If it's all my fault, then I can't be responsible for words or actions I don't remember. I have tried to fight it for so long, but inside I am a monster, and I am very sorry. But I love this life and I fight for it. I can't cut off that horrible side; it's my reality. I can't blame myself for everything I do in moments of breakdown. I have tried so hard to avoid such a state for so long, but you know what happened and who is to blame, and that no one was ready for this.
If we look for the bright side, I have completely forgotten the plots of my favorite movies and cartoons, so I watch them as if for the first time, experiencing the emotions anew and being glad that I have great taste. No, it's still terrible.
I will wait for you again, it doesn't matter if it's in this life or the next.
Thank you for existing, but when we meet again I will bite you. So take care of yourself because you are my victim. I am very angry and offended, and revenge will be cold.
I am a cat.
Bite-bite-bite-bite-bite-bite-bite.
I start to grind my teeth; be afraid of me, adore me, beg for mercy. Meow. It is outrageous.
I don't know.
...
If you can tell me a story, a shared memory, I would be happy (where we talked before, my nickname - kosmospicy). But there is not much hope. Maybe you don't care, everything was a mistake or a lie, and that's why you didn't come back. If it was mutual, you would come back, but you are not here.
Someday I will get to your ass and spank it.
I am anxious that this text will anger or upset you because I didn't mean to. Or maybe you will never read it. To hell with it, crappy situation, I am sending it as it is. This is me; it’s all true. I am a storm, chaos, and madness. No one can endure me, not even myself. This life is so interesting, yet unbearable at the same time. I'm very sorry if I have caused any trouble.
The fact that some of my thoughts or expectations don't match reality is solely my problem. But I'm confused; for some reason, I thought you would be here, but you are not.
...
I am worthless if I lost a kindred spirit. We were such, weren't we?
Maybe when I revealed myself fully, it pushed you away. I didn't want that; I consciously choose to be myself, but it happens, and every time it’s hard to start over, to shape my life when the foundation isn't good material but damned crap.
I feel like a bright art object, and only up close can you see the disgusting trash it's made from.
I’m a damn jerk.
I'm the lowest of the low.
I strive to be healthy always, but I can't.
If you can't forgive me or understand me, that's okay.
Someday, I will dispose of this trash, even if it means disappearing along with it.
I swear I didn't remember and only thought of you in March, when I regained control of my life. You weren't there when things were so bad; I don't know why, deep down, I was counting on you, even though I didn’t deserve it.
Damn it.
This is my hell.
I'm so sorry.
I am my own worst punishment.
If this chapter is closed for you, I'm sorry for reminding you. If that's the case, I hope everything is well with you and I wish you happiness. I suddenly woke up and started missing someone I can't quite remember, but if this friendship has ended, if our connection is broken, I understand. And I promise that I will never bother or remind you of myself again.
Nothing will be the same as before, I can't even ask for that.
But hello
Happy birthday to you
I don’t want to ruin your birthday, so I’ll send it earlier or later. Besides, I don't remember if your birthday is on the 18th or 28th, the 16th or 26th, or maybe the 19th?
It was harder than I imagined and took two days.
We will definitely spend an eternity together, flying side by side through stardust, and our love will never disappear. it's a joke, not a threat
God, first question—why do you not exist? Second—why am I so pathetic right now?
Maybe the person I used to be, the one you knew, is already too different, and it’s not worth reaching out to me. But if you remember me, remember everything except the recent times (when I left home and my usual life, when my inner peace was taken from me, when everything around me was exploding. Since then, everything has gone to hell. Remember the good things until 2022).
.
And poem for you:
«When will it be time to understand
Who are we to ourselves?
Let the nightmare pass by
I'm not that close but I hear thunder
I'm not that far away from becoming nobody
Tell me, will we reach the river?
Through dry branches
Or were we wrong?
Tell me, tell me
Will we reach the river through dry branches?»
.
.
.
Sometimes, the hardest part is accepting that we don’t have all the answers. The point is not to avoid suffering, but to understand it. 
I am here and now with my eyes wide open, reaping the fruits, it's inevitable, I am ready. The wheel of suffering in samsara is like a carousel, I am just a too resilient little bug
hello or goodbye… probably too latе, but I didn't give up

I just want you to come back and send at least one letter or emoji a year. I just want to know that you’re alive and out there somewhere.
I feel empty because it was so hard to remember anything. And it was very difficult to leave this message. It reminds me of a childhood incident when someone tried to walk away from me, and I grabbed their hand and didn't let go for a few more minutes. It hurt so much that I always try to leave first or convince myself that I left first.
I hate being so weak and vulnerable, but now I am immersed in it. For now, I don’t want to let go of your hand.
If you truly can’t accept me with all my flaws, it changes everything. It would mean we were wrong, and everything we had was a lie and an illusion. Only then can I let go of your hand. If I’m certain of that.

In any case, somewhere deep inside, I will always adore you, and if I’m very lucky, I won't completely lose my mind - when I look at the sky it reminds me of that photo. 
And if I do forget, you will still visit me in my dreams.
And if I become so sick, worthless, and unreasonable, it’s probably best that you won't witness it.....................................................................................................................................................I’m like a cockroach that would survive even in space. I crawl out of complete shit. I’m a shit beetle. But it feels like your absence is the most dangerous situation I’ve ever been in. I don't need pity; don't pity me—it demeans me. Better to hate me, despise me, or be indifferent to me.
That’s all. 03.08.2024

I want to say that if I could have done something earlier, I would have tried.
There's so much about me here and very little about you because I'm only beginning to remember things, and right now, it's very little. I remembered the sequences: we stopped talking when I ran away, ruined relationships with everyone, and was left alone. I returned to the place I had to leave, the place I was forced to flee from. I survived. Back then, I had hallucinations and voices in my head, and I didn't sleep for many days.

When my whole life was already destroyed, one of the treatments amidst this chaos started to help. As a result, I slept for more than half a year and needed help with everything. It was so strange to fall asleep while walking or on the toilet. When I started feeling better, I forced myself to do something, but it was very hard to control my body. For example, when I cooked, I could only peel one potato, then I needed to lie down for 5-10 minutes before continuing. Simple things took a lot of time. When I was so physically ill, I was criticized for being "unemployed and lazy"—which made me aggressive. Later, I was grateful that people didn't see how pathetic I was, that they saw a normal person in me and demanded more from me.

I still felt bad, but I couldn't be a burden for so long, so I lied that everything was behind me and I was okay. I forced myself to walk every day, endured heart pain and shortness of breath, and knee pain. It felt like my body was rusted, like I had aged a century. Periodically, I worked, making jewelry on order.

Physical recovery took a couple of months, but panic attacks were so frequent that I couldn't catch my breath. I stopped treatment due to other health problems and spent a couple of months in bed again. As soon as it became possible, I started treatment again, and eventually, I began to feel a bit like myself. But then the doctor said to change the dosage, and everything went to hell. We reverted to the dosage that had helped, and the long wait began... It started helping, and this is mid-summer 2024.
Of course, I was conscious the whole time, I could talk or write, and so on, but everything was in a very thick fog. So thick that I either slept or did things automatically while my brain was still asleep.

At that moment, it wasn't a tragedy; I lived as best I could, tried to be happy and smile. But it was like a bot mode, where there's no full self-awareness, just a program forcing you to continue doing everything to survive.

I gradually "woke up" this spring. Like a flower.
Now I'm undergoing treatment. Sometimes I feel good, sometimes bad, but the main thing is that I'm myself again and have taken control. My brain works, I'm starting to study and work. Finally, I can think.

I made an important conclusion that stupid people don't realize how stupid they are. My psyche adapted to the sleepy brain and imitated "normalcy." I lied that I knew, remembered something. That I understood some contexts, quotes. That my thoughts were so deep I couldn't express them—when in reality, my head was empty. So empty that there were no resources for self-reflection, everything was very superficial but couldn't realize it because there was no access to that level of thinking. And when a ray of awareness appeared that something was wrong, that the tranquilizers suppressed the personality too much, I remembered why all this was necessary and endured further, waiting for significant improvement. And actually, I was very happy despite all the downsides; I cried with joy that I no longer heard those voices in my head, that I saw the world as it was—without hallucinations, like everyone else. For me, it was a miracle then, but now I've gotten used to it.
During that time, there were so many losses, constantly someone was dying, I couldn't feel anything or felt a ton of pain, lay there with tears flowing, and this could only be stopped by pills that made me sleep. I couldn't cry and grieve when someone died, but I could when, for example, I wanted something very sour and couldn't figure out what exactly—it was so strange. I was so defenseless.
It seemed that it would always be like this. That no one even noticed that I disappeared, not even myself. Before, there were always crazy sparks in my eyes, so bright that it was the look of a maniac. They went out, and I hope to get them back.

It's very hard for me to talk about this because I don't like being a victim of circumstances, I don't like being pitied. But I want you to know why...whywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhyмwhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhy...
I'm not trying to justify myself and blame everything on the illness. I'm trying to deal with the consequences. And if you wondered why, why, why, then this is my answer, without embellishment or exaggeration. I'm really very ashamed to share this, I couldn't do anything about myself, once I even couldn't hold my urine. You know how disgusting it is, I'm a charming kitty, I have very fluffy fur. Yes, no pity, okay? I'm too proud and don't accept pity. I'm okay. And if I hurt you a lot, you should feel better knowing that I got paws wet)))) Doctors refused to treat me, referred me to others. They said to be treated in a hospital, not at home, it seemed like the end and there was no way out. They treated me like used material that nothing can be done with.

I constantly lied that I was getting better, tried not to bother anyone, not to complain. When asked what I was doing, I also lied, didn't want to say that I mostly slept and suffered, that it hurt physically and inside. Didn't want to hear banalities like "don't think about bad things," "try going to a psychologist or psychiatrist," "try some herbal concoction or valerian." I tried everything I could reach. I went to the doctor, told them that I had voices in my head screaming at me around the clock. They didn't let me sleep, or I fell asleep, and they suddenly started screaming, scared me a lot. And hallucinations. I realized I was dangerous to myself and others. It seemed to me that the walls were collapsing, that everything was falling, that all the cars on the street were driving straight at me, damn hallucinations. The doctor with a serious face wrote a prescription, I went to the pharmacy and got damn valerian extract, I laughed all the way, I walked and squealed, people looked at me, and I couldn't stop this hysteria. And I also ate some damn mushrooms and medicinal herbs. Somehow made a reversal on the tarot cards and told me that a demon had settled in me and to make him go away, I had to say, "I do not give you permission to control me, demon! Go away," and after that, he would leave, and I would feel better. Oh my God, that's it. Enough of these memories, I can't think about it anymore. This is a burden that I carry, and sooner or later, it will press me to the bottom again. 
If anyone ever asks me what I did during these years, I will say I made jewelry, tried myself in various fields (tried to find job options that didn't require leaving home or communicating with someone). Watched a lot of movies, read books (don't remember anything, can't even give an example), tried to lose weight because I gained weight on antidepressants (no, I just really wanted to lose weight but didn't have the strength to do anything about it and did nothing). Learned foreign languages (no, I was too stupid and couldn't remember anything. I knew them before, and that's how this house of cards for calming others, for maintaining the illusion of "improvement," stood). Drew and wrote a book (that's true, I wrote something between Twilight and Harry Potter. But in such a format as if written by a mentally retarded author. Such crazy reading, you can see how stupid I was there).
Improved my culinary skills (tried to make a cake a few times, but got diarrhea just looking at these masterpieces). Experimented with my hairstyle (in a fit of hysteria, thank God not bald). I will twist everything in a positive direction so that no one suspects. Because the truth is that no one cares about my problems. Everyone has their personal tragedy in life, and it's hard for everyone.
But if I caused you pain and inconvenience... If you were curious about what happened, here is the answer. I think I wronged you; you probably also fell under my ultimate mode. If I could notice when it started, if I could stop it... But I'm a monster, with my words and actions, I brought people to tears, I don't remember this, but sometimes I'm told how much of a bitch I was, what I did and said. It's hard for me to believe. I'm so sorry and very ashamed. I was destroying myself and everything around me until I was forced to sleep. I needed to be put to sleep like a rabid animal.

This is an exception, a special situation, I've revealed everything I remember, trusting my feelings, you needed to know the truth.

For everyone else, I'll embellish this shit with flowers and glitter, as I mentioned above, it's better for everyone. That's all.  04/08
