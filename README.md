Disclaimer: This was meant to be a holiday greeting and not a pit of nonsense, so I’m sending it now.

This message is temporary and will be deleted. But I still haven't figured out how, oh my God...
I'm not afraid of rejection; I'm afraid of not trying. I came to my senses after the exacerbation of the illness, as if I suddenly woke up and noticed that something was missing. My life is like a puzzle with most of the pieces lost or worn out.
Don't bother, don't worry. 
The usual greeting, I had some fragments of dreams. I don't remember anything that happened; I probably won't find out. Because you left and didn't come back. Only in dreams, sometimes something reminds me of the past.
There was a lot of good. Without saying "thank you" or "goodbye" or "fuck you" (lol) – it would be wrong (maybe it was, but I feel like I've been abandoned). I can't believe you're gone.
Just want to say happy birthday.
Happy birthday!
On this special day, I want to take a moment to celebrate you. Happy Birthday! You are incredibly special to me, and I am grateful for every moment we have shared.
I hope the date is correct, but who cares. 
I love/hate you/don't know/don't remember who you are.
And in time I will forget it as I have forgotten you; it's sad.
It's a pity that you are not here, and I don't remember how we met, what games we played, or those photos of the stars. So many copies of this photo on each of my Google drives; it's a treasure I managed to save.
Maybe in the next life, we will understand each other; I would like to try it again. Maybe you are my favorite mistake in all lives and universes.
Yes, I still love you more than I hate you, shit.
If it's all my fault, then I can't be responsible for words or actions I don't remember. I have tried to fight it for so long, but inside I am a monster, and I am very sorry. But I love this life and I fight for it. I can't cut off that horrible side; it's my reality. I can't blame myself for everything I do in moments of breakdown. I have tried so hard to avoid such a state for so long, but you know what happened and who is to blame, and that no one was ready for this.
If we look for the bright side, I have completely forgotten the plots of my favorite movies and cartoons, so I watch them as if for the first time, experiencing the emotions anew and being glad that I have great taste. No, it's still terrible.
I will wait for you again, it doesn't matter if it's in this life or the next.
Thank you for existing, but when we meet again I will bite you. So take care of yourself because you are my victim. I am very angry and offended, and revenge will be cold.
I am a cat.
Bite-bite-bite-bite-bite-bite-bite.
I start to grind my teeth; be afraid of me, adore me, beg for mercy. Meow. It is outrageous.
I don't know.
...
If you can tell me a story, a shared memory, I would be happy (where we talked before, my nickname - kosmospicy). But there is not much hope. Maybe you don't care, everything was a mistake or a lie, and that's why you didn't come back. If it was mutual, you would come back, but you are not here.
Someday I will get to your ass and spank it.
I am anxious that this text will anger or upset you because I didn't mean to. Or maybe you will never read it. To hell with it, crappy situation, I am sending it as it is. This is me; it’s all true. I am a storm, chaos, and madness. No one can endure me, not even myself. This life is so interesting, yet unbearable at the same time. I'm very sorry if I have caused any trouble.
The fact that some of my thoughts or expectations don't match reality is solely my problem. But I'm confused; for some reason, I thought you would be here, but you are not.
...
I am worthless if I lost a kindred spirit. We were such, weren't we?
Maybe when I revealed myself fully, it pushed you away. I didn't want that; I consciously choose to be myself, but it happens, and every time it’s hard to start over, to shape my life when the foundation isn't good material but damned crap.
I feel like a bright art object, and only up close can you see the disgusting trash it's made from.
I’m a damn jerk.
I'm the lowest of the low.
I strive to be healthy always, but I can't.
If you can't forgive me or understand me, that's okay.
Someday, I will dispose of this trash, even if it means disappearing along with it.
I swear I didn't remember and only thought of you in March, when I regained control of my life. You weren't there when things were so bad; I don't know why, deep down, I was counting on you, even though I didn’t deserve it.
Damn it.
This is my hell.
I'm so sorry.
I am my own worst punishment.
If this chapter is closed for you, I'm sorry for reminding you. If that's the case, I hope everything is well with you and I wish you happiness. I suddenly woke up and started missing someone I can't quite remember, but if this friendship has ended, if our connection is broken, I understand. And I promise that I will never bother or remind you of myself again.
Nothing will be the same as before, I can't even ask for that.
But hello
Happy birthday to you
I don’t want to ruin your birthday, so I’ll send it earlier or later. Besides, I don't remember if your birthday is on the 18th or 28th, the 16th or 26th, or maybe the 19th?
It was harder than I imagined and took two days.
We will definitely spend an eternity together, flying side by side through stardust, and our love will never disappear. it's a joke, not a threat
God, first question—why do you not exist? Second—why am I so pathetic right now?
Maybe the person I used to be, the one you knew, is already too different, and it’s not worth reaching out to me. But if you remember me, remember everything except the recent times (when I left home and my usual life, when my inner peace was taken from me, when everything around me was exploding. Since then, everything has gone to hell. Remember the good things until 2022).
.
And poem for you:
«When will it be time to understand
Who are we to ourselves?
Let the nightmare pass by
I'm not that close but I hear thunder
I'm not that far away from becoming nobody
Tell me, will we reach the river?
Through dry branches
Or were we wrong?
Tell me, tell me
Will we reach the river through dry branches?»
.

Sometimes, the hardest part is accepting that we don’t have all the answers. The point is not to avoid suffering, but to understand it. 
I am here and now with my eyes wide open, reaping the fruits, it's inevitable, I am ready. The wheel of suffering in samsara is like a carousel, I am just a too resilient little bug
hello or goodbye… probably too latе, but I didn't give up

I just want you to come back and send at least one letter or emoji a year. I just want to know that you’re alive and out there somewhere.
I feel empty because it was so hard to remember anything. And it was very difficult to leave this message. It reminds me of a childhood incident when someone tried to walk away from me, and I grabbed their hand and didn't let go for a few more minutes. It hurt so much that I always try to leave first or convince myself that I left first.
I hate being so weak and vulnerable, but now I am immersed in it. For now, I don’t want to let go of your hand.
If you truly can’t accept me with all my flaws, it changes everything. It would mean we were wrong, and everything we had was a lie and an illusion. Only then can I let go of your hand. If I’m certain of that.

In any case, somewhere deep inside, I will always adore you, and if I’m very lucky, I won't completely lose my mind - when I look at the sky it reminds me of that photo. 
And if I do forget, you will still visit me in my dreams.
And if I become so sick, worthless, and unreasonable, it’s probably best that you won't witness it.....................................................................................................................................................I’m like a cockroach that would survive even in space. I crawl out of complete shit. I’m a shit beetle. But it feels like your absence is the most dangerous situation I’ve ever been in. I don't need pity; don't pity me—it demeans me. Better to hate me, despise me, or be indifferent to me.
That’s all. 03.08.2024
